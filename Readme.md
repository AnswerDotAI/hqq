## Half-Quadratic Quantization (HQQ)
This folder contains the code to perform Half-Quadratic Quantization (<b>HQQ</b>) presented in our article: https://mobiusml.github.io/hqq_blog/ 

### WHat is HQQ?
<b>HQQ</b> is a fast and accurate model quantizer that skips the need for calibration data. It's super simple to implement (just a few lines of code for the optimizer). It can crunch through quantizing the Llama2-70B model in only 4 minutes! üöÄ

### Installation 
First, make sure you have a Pytorch 2 version that matches your CUDA version: https://pytorch.org/

You can install hqq via  ```pip install hqq```. 

To get the latest version, you can install the core library directly via ```pip install git+https://github.com/mobiusml/hqq.git```. 

Alternatively, clone the repo and run ```pip install .``` from this current folder. 

### Important ‚ö†Ô∏è
If you are using a virtual machine on the cloud, make sure you limit the number of threads to only those available. Otherwise, processing will be unusually slow, especially for the GPTQ benchmark. You can do that by limiting the OMP threads:
```
num_threads=32; OMP_NUM_THREADS=$num_threads CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python 
```

### Basic Usage
To perform quantization with HQQ, you simply need to replace the linear layers ( ```torch.nn.Linear```) as follows:
```Python
from hqq.core.quantize import *
#Quantization settings
quant_config = BaseQuantizeConfig(nbits=4, group_size=64, quant_zero=True, quant_scale=False)
#Replace your linear layer 
hqq_layer = HQQLinear(your_linear_layer, quant_config, del_orig=True)
#del_orig=True will remove the original linear layer from memory
```

The quantization parameters are set as follows:

- ```nbits``` (int): supports 8, 4, 3, 2 bits.
- ```group_size``` (int): no restrictions as long as ```weight.numel()``` is divisible by the ```group_size```.
- ```quant_zero``` (bool): if True, it quantizes the zero-point to 8-bit without grouping.
- ```quant_scale``` (bool): if True, it quantizes the scaling factor to 8-bit with a group_size of 128.

You can try to change the backend which could speed-up the runtime:
```Python
HQQLinear.set_backend(HQQBackend.PYTORCH)         #Pytorch backend (default) 
HQQLinear.set_backend(HQQBackend.PYTORCH_COMPILE) #Compiled Pytorch (fastest but potentially issues)
HQQLinear.set_backend(HQQBackend.ATEN)            #C++ Aten/Torch backend (experimental)
```
In order to use the ATEN backend (experimental), you need to build it via:
```
cd hqq/kernels && python setup.py install;
```

### Supported Models
#### LLMs 
- Llama (Hugging Face + VLLM) ü¶ô
- Mixtral-8x7B (Hugging Face)

#### Vision 
- ViT-CLIP (timm) üñºÔ∏è

### Hugging Face ü§ó
First, make sure you have your Hugging Face token properly set via:
```
huggingface-cli login --token <your-token>
```

You can quantize a Hugging Face model as follows:
```Python
from hqq.engine.hf import HQQModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
model_id   = 'meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf'

#Load model on the CPU
######################
model     = HQQModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_id)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id) 

#Quantize the model
######################
from hqq.core.quantize import *
quant_config = BaseQuantizeConfig(nbits=4, group_size=64)
model.quantize_model(quant_config=quant_config)

#Optional: set backend
######################
HQQLinear.set_backend(HQQBackend.PYTORCH_COMPILE)
```

You can save/load a quantized model as follows:
```Python
#Save the quantized model
model.save_quantized(model, save_dir=save_dir)
#Load from local directory or Hugging Face Hub
model = HQQModelForCausalLM.from_quantized(save_dir_or_hfhub)
```

Alternatively, you can also work with models created via ```transformers.AutoModelForCausalLM```:
```Python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_id) 
#Quantize
HQQModelForCausalLM.quantize_model_(model, quant_config=quant_config)
```

### VLLM üöÄ
By default, VLLM is not installed to avoid CUDA version problems. Make sure you install the right version that matches your CUDA settings (vllm <= 0.2.2): 
https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/getting_started/installation.html 

After installation, you can quantize VLLM models as follows:

```Python
from hqq.engine.vllm import HQQLLM
model_id = 'meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf'

#Loads the model (on CPU)
######################
model = HQQLLM(model=model_id)

#Quantize the model and dispatch on GPU
######################
from hqq.core.quantize import *
quant_config = BaseQuantizeConfig(nbits=4, group_size=64)
model.quantize_model(quant_config=quant_config)

#Optional: set backend
######################
HQQLinear.set_backend(HQQBackend.PYTORCH_COMPILE)
```

Additionally, you can use the quantized model in Langchain (requires ```pip install langchain```) as follows:

```Python
from hqq.engine.vllm import LangchainVLLM
llm = LangchainVLLM(max_new_tokens=1000, top_p=0.90, temperature=0.6).set(model)
print(llm("Who is Elon Musk?"))
```

You can save/load a quantized model as follows:
```Python
#Save the quantized model
model.save_quantized(model, save_dir=save_dir)
#Load from local directory or Hugging Face Hub
model = HQQLLM.from_quantized(save_dir_or_hfhub)
```

Notes:
- The VLLM backend only works with a single GPU for now.
- Only VLLM models created via ```save_quantized``` can be loaded with ```HQQLLM.from_quantized```.

### Timm üñºÔ∏è
Timm backend is also supported. Here's how you use it:

```Python
model_id = 'vit_large_patch14_clip_224.laion2b'

#Load model on the CPU
######################
from hqq.engine.timm import HQQtimm
model = HQQtimm.create_model(model_id, pretrained=True)

#Quantize the model
######################
from hqq.core.quantize import *
quant_config = BaseQuantizeConfig(nbits=4, group_size=64)
model.quantize_model(quant_config=quant_config)

#Optional: set backend
######################
HQQLinear.set_backend(HQQBackend.PYTORCH_COMPILE)
```

You can save/load the quantized models as follows:
```Python
#Save the quantized model
model.save_quantized(model, save_dir=save_dir)
#Load from local directory or Hugging Face Hub
model = HQQtimm.from_quantized(save_dir_or_hfhub)
```

### Quantize Custom Models üóúÔ∏è
If you want to quantize your own model architecture, you need to write a patching logic that goes through all the linear layers and replaces them with ```HQQLinear```. You can follow the examples provided in ```hqq/models```.

### Custom Quantization Configurations ‚öôÔ∏è
You can specify different quantization configs for different layers by feeding a dictionary in the form ```linear_tag: BaseQuantizeConfig()```, The following example uses 4-bit for ```self_attn.v_proj``` and 2-bit for the rest of the layers:
```Python
from hqq.core.quantize import *
linear_tags  = HQQModelForCausalLM.get_linear_tags(model) #List of tags for the linear layers of the model
q2_config    = BaseQuantizeConfig(nbits=2, group_size=16, quant_scale=True) #2-bit config
q4_config    = BaseQuantizeConfig(nbits=4, group_size=64, quant_zero=True, quant_scale=False) #4-bit config
quant_config = dict([(k, q2_config) for k in linear_tags])
quant_config['self_attn.v_proj'] = q4_config

#Quantize 
model.quantize_model(quant_config=quant_config)
```

### Examples 
We provide a variety of examples demonstrating model quantization across different backends within the ```examples```  directory.

In the ```examples/llama2_benchmark```directory, you'll find code to replicate our Llama2 benchmark. By default, this benchmark quantizes the Llama2-7B model with 4-bit precision and provides perplexity metrics on wikitext-2.

To execute the benchmark, ensure you have the datasets package installed by running  ```pip install datasets```. Additionally, for the GPTQ and AWQ demos, you'll need to install the following packages: ```pip install auto-gptq[triton]==0.4.2 autoawq==0.1.4 triton==2.0.0```

After installation, configure your Hugging Face ü§ó token either through the command line or within the demo files, and you're all set!
